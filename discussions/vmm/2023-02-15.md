## :dart: Agenda

- Status update
- Next steps

## :closed_book: Discussions

### Hyper-V

PV: Provided [netvsc support timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ur2icVsnjHz7iP3cAaAc-eBIyU8lnS2PWaUyMkphhVw/edit?usp=sharing)

PV: Issues with the `hn_rndis_set_rxfilter` function. I put it on hold and moved on with lwip init.

MR: Does the function use the same communication channel as the other requests?

PV: Yes, the communication is set up and I'm able to send/receive messages over the VMbus channel.
It's the same communication channel, but different command.

PV: I'm receiving 6 messages from the hypervisor (each around 420 bytes), but not the compleation message I'm expecting.

MR: Is this the only command that is not working for rndis?

PV: Other commands work.

PV: Now I'm working on lwip initialization. So far `lwip_init` doesn't do anything since the network driver (for hyper-v) doesn't provide any interface for uknetdev.

### VMware

PU: Provided project timeline on the `#vmm-general` channel on Discord.

### Firecracker

AT: Started updating the PR for boot support, but found https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/760 meanwhile.

AT: Continued troubleshooting `vsock_connect` function.

## :wrench: TODOs and Decisions

AT: Work on vsock support.

AT: Review https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/pull/760
